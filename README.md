<h4>Few things about me:</h4>
<p>
I am a former athlete, my sport was swimming and thanks to this sport I was able to have a scholarshipv in the United States in order to make a double projet. <br>
Indeed, after my "BaccalaurÃ©at" in France, I went to Southwestern Oregon Comunity College to practice my sport and study at the same time. </br>
I ended up with an Associate of Science/Oregon Transfer degree in Computer Science. </br>
Finally after more than 12 years of my life swimming, I wanted to start to focus on my carrer, that is why I decided to join the Prestigious 42 School in Lyon.
